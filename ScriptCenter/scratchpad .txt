- Refactor installer log to take any stream instead of always writing to file? 
- Consider changing Do/Undo methods on InstallerAction to Install/Uninstall/Update.
- Refactor CuiFile, KbdFile and perhaps JsonFileHandler to take Stream arguments to make the class more flexible and testable.
- BUG: CopyDir/CopyFile action grows exclude property when loading/saving.
