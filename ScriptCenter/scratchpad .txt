- Refactor CuiFile, KbdFile and perhaps JsonFileHandler to take Stream arguments to make the class more flexible and testable.
- BUG: When selecting C:/, path ends up with // at the end.
- BUG: Cannot click "export" when manifest in package is selected.
- Use manifest tokens in scriptversion when using packages.
